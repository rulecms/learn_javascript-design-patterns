Understanding design patterns is crucial for every JavaScript developer. These patterns represent proven solutions to recurring problems in software design, and mastering them is often the difference between junior and senior developers. They frequently appear in technical interviews at top companies, making them essential knowledge for career advancement.

I'm excited to share a comprehensive JavaScript Design Patterns tutorial that covers 12 essential patterns with interactive examples and clear explanations.

The tutorial covers three categories of patterns:

Creational Patterns - Control object creation mechanisms
- Singleton: Ensures only one instance of a class exists
- Factory: Creates objects without specifying exact classes
- Builder: Constructs complex objects step by step
- Prototype: Creates objects by cloning existing instances

Structural Patterns - Compose objects to form larger structures
- Adapter: Makes incompatible interfaces work together
- Decorator: Adds new functionality to objects dynamically
- Facade: Provides simplified interface to complex systems
- Proxy: Provides placeholder or surrogate for another object

Behavioral Patterns - Define communication between objects
- Observer: Manages dependencies between objects
- Mediator: Centralizes complex object communications
- Strategy: Encapsulates algorithms for interchangeability
- Command: Encapsulates requests as objects

What makes this tutorial stand out:
- Real-world TypeScript examples with syntax highlighting
- Beautiful dark theme optimized for developers
- Each pattern explained with practical use cases
- Open source and free to use
- Built with modern web technologies

Whether you're preparing for interviews or looking to level up your JavaScript skills, this resource provides everything you need to master design patterns.
